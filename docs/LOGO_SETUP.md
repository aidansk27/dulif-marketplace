# 🎨 Logo Setup Guide for dulif™

## Quick Answer: **SVG is Best!** 

### 🏆 **Recommended: Upload an SVG file**

**Why SVG?**
- ✅ Scales perfectly at any size
- ✅ Small file size
- ✅ Sharp on all devices (retina, mobile, desktop)
- ✅ Easy to modify colors programmatically

### 📁 **How to Add Your Logo:**

1. **Save your logo as `dulif-logo.svg`**
2. **Put it in the `public/` folder** (replace the current temporary one)
3. **That's it!** The app will automatically use it

### 📋 **Logo Specifications:**

- **Format**: SVG (preferred) or PNG
- **Size**: 120px wide x 40px tall (approximate)
- **Colors**: Use Berkeley Blue (#003262) and California Gold (#FDB515)
- **Style**: Clean, professional, readable

### 💡 **Current Status:**

Right now you have a **temporary logo** that's just a "D" icon + "dulif™" text. This is automatically generated and styled with Berkeley colors.

### 🔧 **Alternative Formats:**

If you only have other formats:
- **PNG**: Also works great, just name it `dulif-logo.png`
- **JPG**: Works but not ideal (no transparency)

### 📤 **How to Upload:**

1. **Via Finder**: Drag your logo file into `/Users/aidankathein/Projects/dulif-marketplace/public/`
2. **Rename it**: Make sure it's named exactly `dulif-logo.svg` or `dulif-logo.png`
3. **Refresh browser**: Your logo will appear immediately!
